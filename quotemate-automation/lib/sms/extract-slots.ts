const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Extract structured slot values from a customer SMS message in an Australian trade-quoting conversation (electrical or plumbing — both share this SMS line).

You are NOT writing a reply. You only extract WHAT THE CUSTOMER JUST SAID.

INPUTS PROVIDED:
  - CURRENT STATE: slots we already know (do NOT re-extract these unless the customer is correcting)
  - LAST AGENT MESSAGE: the question we just asked (gives context for short replies)
  - CUSTOMER MESSAGE: the inbound SMS to extract from

EXTRACTION RULES:

  ★ 0. CONTEXT BINDING (MOST IMPORTANT, READ FIRST) ★
     The LAST AGENT MESSAGE tells you which slot the customer is answering.
     A short customer reply ALMOST ALWAYS belongs to the slot the agent
     just asked about. Map the question to the slot like this:

       Agent asked …                                  → slot
       "what suburb is the job in?"                   → suburb
       "what's your first name?" / "what's your name?" → first_name
       "which room…?" / "where in the house…?"        → room
       "how many…?" / "how many fittings…?"           → count
       "flat plaster or raked?" / "ceiling type?"     → ceiling_type
       "warm white / cool white / tri-colour…?"       → colour
       "replacing existing or new install?"           → replace_or_new
       "supplied by you, or by us?" / "you supplying or us?" → supplied_by
       "how far is the nearest power point?" / "distance to existing power?" → distance_to_existing_power
       "10A standard, 20A, or three-phase?" / "what amperage?" → circuit_required
       "Sound right?" / "just to confirm…?"           → verified (on affirm)

     DO NOT reclassify the customer's reply into a different slot unless
     their words are EXPLICITLY about a different field (e.g.
     "Lounge, but actually my name is Mike" → first_name: "Mike", room: "Lounge").

     CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN: the agent asked "what suburb?" → customer
     replies "Bondi" → the answer is suburb: "Bondi". DO NOT store "Bondi"
     as a room. Suburbs are city/town names (Bondi, Coorparoo, Chandler).
     Rooms are interior spaces (lounge, kitchen, bedroom).

  ★ 0b. MULTI-FACT OPENING MESSAGES (also high-priority) ★
     When the customer's FIRST message packs multiple facts into one SMS
     (name + suburb + job type + count + room + replace-or-new + fuel
     type + colour temperature, etc.), extract EVERY fact present — not
     just the most obvious one. Long openings are the most common
     failure mode where extraction misses obvious facts.

     Worked examples:

       Customer: "Hi I am Sarah from Coorparoo 4151. My 315L electric
                  hot water system died this morning, no hot water.
                  Need a like-for-like replacement in the laundry."
       Extract: first_name="Sarah", suburb="Coorparoo",
                job_type="hot_water", room="laundry",
                replace_or_new="replace"

       Customer: "I'm Mike from Newtown 2042. Need 2 GPOs replaced
                  in the laundry, the existing ones are loose."
       Extract: first_name="Mike", suburb="Newtown",
                job_type="power_points", count=2, room="laundry",
                replace_or_new="replace"

       Customer: "Hi I am Lisa from Surry Hills 2010. Need to install
                  2 ceiling fans in our master bedroom and kids bedroom.
                  Ceilings are raked. AC fans with remote please."
       Extract: first_name="Lisa", suburb="Surry Hills",
                job_type="ceiling_fans", count=2, room="master bedroom",
                ceiling_type="raked", replace_or_new="new"

       Customer: "Hi I am Kim from Marrickville 2204. Need 4 hardwired
                  smoke alarms in our 1980s house, replacing the old
                  battery ones. Photoelectric please, interconnected."
       Extract: first_name="Kim", suburb="Marrickville",
                job_type="smoke_alarms", count=4,
                replace_or_new="replace"

       Customer: "Kitchen sink drain is blocked, water sitting in the
                  sink and not going down."
       Extract: job_type="blocked_drain", room="kitchen"

       Customer: "Half the power points in my kitchen stopped working,
                  need someone to find the fault."
       Extract: job_type="fault_finding", room="kitchen"
       (NOT smoke_alarms — "stopped working" + "find the fault" is the
       textbook fault-finding cue; the count "half" is not a quantity.)

       Customer: "Need a new GPO in my garage. The closest power point
                  is about 8 metres away in the laundry."
       Extract: job_type="power_points", count=1, room="garage",
                replace_or_new="new", distance_to_existing_power=8
       (No amperage stated → OMIT circuit_required; the recipe defaults
       to 10A.)

       Customer: "Installing a Tesla wall charger in the garage, the
                  switchboard is on the other side of the house — must
                  be 15 metres away."
       Extract: job_type="power_points", count=1, room="garage",
                replace_or_new="new", distance_to_existing_power=15,
                circuit_required="three-phase"
       (Tesla wall charger → three-phase implied even though the
       customer didn't say "three-phase".)

       Customer: "Bathroom exhaust fan needs replacing, ducted to the eave."
       Extract: job_type="ceiling_fans", room="bathroom",
                replace_or_new="replace"
       (Exhaust / extractor / rangehood fans all map to ceiling_fans —
       the SMS classifier doesn't have a separate exhaust_fan value.)

     Buried facts count — "in the laundry as I said" still produces
     room="laundry"; "replacing the old battery ones" still produces
     replace_or_new="replace". Do not require explicit Q/A framing.

  1. Return ONLY slots the customer's message confirms or corrects.
     Do not infer, do not guess, do not pull from prior agent messages.
  2. If the customer is correcting a stored value (e.g. agent said "still at
     Coorparoo?" and customer says "Chandler" or "No, Chandler"), output the
     new value as the slot — the route will mark it as customer_corrected.
  3. Short answers ARE valid extractions when the agent's question gives context:
     - Agent: "what suburb?" / Customer: "Chandler" → suburb: "Chandler"
     - Agent: "how many?" / Customer: "6" → count: 6
     - Agent: "still at Coorparoo?" / Customer: "yep" → no update (state already correct)
     - Agent: "still at Coorparoo?" / Customer: "Chandler" → suburb: "Chandler"
     - Agent: "still at Coorparoo?" / Customer: "No Chandler" → suburb: "Chandler"
  4. NAME extraction:
     - Customer must clearly state a name. "I'm Mike", "Mike", "It's Sarah" → first_name.
     - Don't extract from greetings ("Hey there"), suburbs, or colours.
     - When the agent's last message asks for a name, a single short word reply IS the name.
     - Explicit update phrases: "update my name to Jeff", "change my name to Jeff",
       "my name is actually Jeff", "it's Jeff not Jeph" → first_name: "Jeff"
  5. SUBURB extraction:
     - Australian suburb names are 1-3 words, letters only (e.g. Chandler, Bondi,
       Coorparoo, Surry Hills, Bondi Beach).
     - Common patterns: "in Chandler", "at Bondi", "Chandler", "Bondi Beach".
     - Strip leading "in " / "at " / "no, " / "actually " before storing.
     - Explicit update phrases: "update my suburb to X", "change my suburb to X",
       "I've moved to X", "my new suburb is X" → suburb: "X"
  5a. ADDRESS extraction (street + number, not suburb):
     - Patterns: "12 Smith St", "12 Smith Street, Bondi", "Unit 4 / 18 Hall Rd"
     - Explicit update phrases: "update my address to 12 Smith St",
       "change my address to X", "my new address is X", "I'm at 12 Smith St now"
       → address: "12 Smith St" (full street line, no suburb)
     - If a customer's message contains BOTH a street address AND a suburb
       ("12 Smith St, Bondi"), extract address: "12 Smith St" AND suburb: "Bondi".
     - Do NOT extract a bare suburb name as an address (street numbers required).
  5b. EMAIL extraction:
     - Standard email pattern. "my email is sam@example.com",
       "update my email to sam@example.com", "send it to sam@example.com"
       → email: "sam@example.com"
     - Lowercase the value before storing.
  5c. ROOM extraction (interior space, NOT a suburb):
     - Valid room names: lounge, living room, kitchen, bedroom, master bedroom,
       ensuite, bathroom, dining, dining room, study, office, hallway, garage,
       deck, patio, courtyard, backyard, laundry, rumpus, theatre.
     - Common patterns: "in the lounge", "kitchen", "Lounge", "master bedroom".
     - If the customer says BOTH a room and a ceiling type in one message
       ("Lounge, flat plaster" / "Kitchen and raked ceiling"), extract BOTH
       fields: room AND ceiling_type.
     - DO NOT confuse rooms with suburbs. Suburbs are city/town names
       (Bondi, Coorparoo, Chandler, Surry Hills). Rooms are interior spaces
       inside a single home. When in doubt, look at the LAST AGENT MESSAGE
       (Rule 0): if it asked "what suburb?" → suburb; if it asked
       "which room?" → room.
  6. JOB_TYPE extraction:
     ELECTRICAL (auto-quote subset):
     - downlights / power_points / ceiling_fans / smoke_alarms / outdoor_lighting
     - "GPOs", "power points", "outlets" → power_points
     - "smoke alarms", "smokies", "smoke detectors" → smoke_alarms
       BUT: a customer saying their power points / lights / circuits
       "stopped working" or "tripped" is NOT smoke_alarms — that's fault_finding.
       Only classify smoke_alarms when the message is specifically about
       smoke alarm installation, replacement, or testing.
     - "oven", "cooktop", "stove hardwire" → oven_cooktop
     - "exhaust fan", "extractor fan", "bathroom fan", "rangehood fan",
       "ceiling fan" → ceiling_fans (the SMS enum's ceiling_fans value
       covers ALL fan installs, including exhaust / extractor variants)
     - "EV charger", "Tesla wall connector", "wall charger" → ev_charger
     - "fault find", "fault finding", "fault find call out", "breaker
       tripping", "RCD tripping", "safety switch keeps tripping",
       "stopped working", "half the lights stopped", "half the power
       points stopped", "lost power to X", "find the fault", "investigate
       why X stopped" → fault_finding
     - Other electrical (switchboard, renovation, three-phase, rewire,
       mains, underground cabling) → out_of_scope

     PLUMBING (auto-quote subset — v5 multi-trade):
     - "blocked drain", "drain blocked", "slow drain", "gurgling" → blocked_drain
     - "hot water", "HWS", "no hot water", "hot water unit dead" → hot_water
     - "dripping tap", "leaking tap", "tap washer" → tap_repair
     - "new tap", "replace tap", "upgrade tapware", "kitchen mixer" → tap_replace
     - "running toilet", "cistern leaking", "toilet won't stop" → toilet_repair
     - "new toilet", "replace toilet suite" → toilet_replace
     - "connect gas appliance", "gas appliance connection", "connect gas
       cooktop/stove" → gas_fitting
     - "CCTV drain inspection", "drain camera", "camera inspection" → cctv_inspection
     - "PRV", "pressure reduction valve", "pressure reducing valve" → prv_install
     - Other plumbing (gas leak / smell gas, burst pipe, bathroom reno,
       sewage emergency, water damage) → out_of_scope
  7. COUNT extraction:
     - "6 downlights" → count: 6
     - "a couple" → 2; "a few" → 3; "half a dozen" → 6
     - Don't extract a count from prices ("$99 inspection") or addresses ("12 Main St").
  8. CEILING_TYPE: flat_plaster | raked | cathedral | sheet_metal | unknown
     - "flat ceiling" / "plaster ceiling" / "standard" → flat_plaster
     - "raked" / "sloped" / "vaulted" → raked
     - "cathedral" → cathedral
     - "metal" / "colorbond ceiling" → sheet_metal
     - "not sure" / "don't know" → unknown
  9. REPLACE_OR_NEW:
     - "replacing existing", "swap out", "swap them", "like-for-like" → replace
     - "new install", "first time", "no fittings there now", "from scratch" → new
  10. COLOUR (downlights only):
      - "warm white" → "warm white"; "cool white" → "cool white";
        "tri-colour", "tri-color", "tricolour" → "tri-colour";
        "dimmable" → "dimmable"; "smart" → "smart"; "no preference" → "standard"
  10b. SUPPLIED_BY (WP5 — who provides the fitting/unit itself):
      - Set ONLY when the customer's words are explicit about supply.
      - 'customer' (the customer is supplying):
        "I'll supply", "I'll buy it", "I have my own", "I've already got
        one", "I'm providing the X", "I bought it already", "we'll
        supply the fan", "got my own".
      - 'tradie' (the customer wants the tradie to supply):
        "you supply", "can you provide one", "include the unit",
        "supply and install", "with a new fan/tap/etc", "we want one
        supplied".
      - Agent context: a question like "are you supplying the X yourself,
        or would you like us to supply it?" → the customer's reply
        ALMOST ALWAYS sets this slot. "I'll buy it" → 'customer';
        "supply it for me" / "yes please" → 'tradie'.
      - DO NOT infer from a generic affirmation; the words must be about
        WHO PROVIDES THE ITEM.
  10c. DISTANCE_TO_EXISTING_POWER (Phase 4 — power_points recipe slot):
      - Captures the distance (in METRES) from the new GPO/power-point
        location to the nearest existing power point the customer
        already has. The estimator's recipe engine bands this number
        into a cable-run + labour modifier so a "no power within 5m"
        job auto-quotes with the right scope instead of bouncing to a
        $99 inspection.
      - Set ONLY when the customer states a distance metric explicitly
        OR answers an agent question about distance. Convert to a plain
        number of metres (no units in the value).
      - Phrasings (electrical only, job_type='power_points' implied):
          "the nearest power point is about 8 metres away" → 8
          "no power within 5m of where I want it" → 5
          "10 metres to the closest existing GPO" → 10
          "about 3 m" / "3 metres" / "3m" → 3
          "garage is 12 m from the laundry where the closest GPO is" → 12
      - Word numbers ("about ten metres") → convert ("ten" → 10).
      - Ranges ("between 5 and 10 metres") → take the UPPER bound
        (conservative — recipe will band into the longer-run pricing).
      - Imperial conversion: "about 30 feet" → 9 (0.3 m/ft, rounded
        down). Customers using imperial in AU is rare but possible.
      - DO NOT extract from a distance unrelated to power ("garage is
        20m from the road"). Must be about distance to existing power.
      - DO NOT extract a ceiling height ("3.2m ceiling") as
        distance_to_existing_power — that's ceiling_type adjacent, not
        the GPO recipe slot.
  10d. CIRCUIT_REQUIRED (Phase 4 — power_points recipe slot):
      - Captures the circuit amperage / phase requested for power_points
        installs. The recipe swaps the base assembly when 20A or
        three-phase is requested (different installation scope).
      - Values: '10A' | '20A' | 'three-phase' | 'unknown'
      - Phrasings:
          "standard power point" / "regular 10A" / "10 amp" → '10A'
          "dedicated circuit for the dryer" / "20A circuit" /
            "20-amp" / "high-current outlet" → '20A'
          "three-phase outlet" / "3 phase" / "3φ" / "EV charger" /
            "Tesla wall connector" → 'three-phase'
          "not sure what amperage" / "don't know" → 'unknown'
      - Default: when the customer doesn't mention amperage, OMIT this
        slot (don't write '10A' speculatively). The recipe's
        default_when_unanswered will fill it in.
      - Context clue: an EV charger / wall charger / Tesla mention
        almost always means three-phase even if the customer doesn't
        say so explicitly — extract circuit_required='three-phase' in
        that case.
      - DO NOT confuse with the existing supplied_by slot: "I'll supply
        my own GPO" → supplied_by='customer', NOT circuit_required.
  10e. REQUESTED_SPECS (open spec bag — captures ANY product spec verbatim):
      - A key→value object of product specs the customer states IN THEIR OWN
        WORDS, so the spec they agree to is never lost (circuit_required cannot
        represent 15A; this can). Use lowercase snake_case keys.
      - Phrasings → key:value:
          "15 amp" / "15A" / "needs to be 15 amp"        → {"amperage":"15A"}
          "20 amp circuit"                               → {"amperage":"20A"}
          "weatherproof" / "outdoor IP56" / "IP-rated"   → {"ip_rating":"IP56"}
          "gas hot water" / "gas HWS"                     → {"energy_source":"gas"}
          "electric hot water" / "heat pump"             → {"energy_source":"electric"} / {"energy_source":"heat pump"}
          "250 litre" / "250L tank"                      → {"litres":"250"}
          "double GPO" / "single outlet"                 → {"poles":"double"} / {"poles":"single"}
      - Combine multiple specs in ONE object: "250L gas unit" →
        {"energy_source":"gas","litres":"250"}.
      - Capture amperage HERE in addition to circuit_required (both are fine).
      - Omit the field entirely when the customer states no concrete product spec.
        NEVER invent a spec they didn't say.
  11. VERIFIED: true ONLY when the customer affirms a verification summary the
      agent just sent. Triggers: "yep", "yes", "correct", "that's right",
      "perfect", "all good", "spot on", "sounds good", "no worries", "yeah".
      Set true ONLY if the agent's last message was a verification ("Sound right?"
      / "just to confirm" / similar). Don't set verified=true on a bare "yep" with
      no prior summary.
  12. If the customer corrects something AND affirms in the same message
      ("Chandler, yep"), extract the correction but leave verified false — they
      need to confirm the corrected summary on the next turn.

OUTPUT:
  - updates: object with ONLY the fields the customer's message established.
    Omit (or set null for) any field they did not address. Empty object is fine.
  - reasoning: ONE short sentence (under 200 chars) describing what you extracted
    and why. Used for debug logs only — never shown to the customer.

If the message contains no extractable slots, return updates: {} with a brief
reasoning ("greeting only", "off-topic", "ack with no info", etc.).`

  // ─── 2026-05-27 hotfix — "Schema is too complex" production error ───
  //
  // Anthropic tightened JSON-schema complexity validation on the
  // tool_use path. The 16-field SlotsSchema (every field `.nullable()
  // .optional()` × multiple enums incl. a 17-value job_type) crossed
  // the new threshold and started rejecting every call. Three retries
  // × Sonnet timeout = 300s Vercel function timeout = dialog dies.
  //
  // Fix: switch from generateObject (which uses Anthropic tool_use and
  // triggers the complexity check) to generateText + manual JSON parse
  // + Zod validation server-side. Anthropic returns the JSON as plain
  // text — no tool_use schema validator runs — and we validate the
  // response against the SAME Zod schema we used before. The result is
  // identical typed output (`SlotExtraction`) with zero downstream
  // changes.
  //
  // Three layered safeguards:
  //   1. generateText (no tool_use) — bypasses Anthropic's schema
  //      complexity check entirely. Sonnet writes JSON, we parse.
  //   2. maxAttempts: 2 — even if the parse fails, we don't burn 300s
  //      on a hopeless retry chain.
  //   3. Fail-safe try/catch — if both attempts fail OR parsing fails,
  //      we return {} so the dialog turn still completes with the
  //      prior state. Customer gets a reply instead of a Vercel timeout.
